            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Growing up I was intrigued on how gaming apps worked. I realized it helped in brainstorming and relaxing one's mind after a long day of working and studying. I developed interest in getting to know more about the technology behind gaming apps. This gave me the desire to pursue a career in software development to acquire the  necessary skills . 

I am eager to connect with other software developers in this field so as  to be able to support my growth in this career.
